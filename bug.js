This React Native code uses `Dimensions.get('window')` to get the screen dimensions.  This approach can lead to inaccurate dimensions, especially on Android devices, and is no longer the recommended way to get the device screen size.  It's prone to delays and might not reflect the actual screen size immediately after the app starts or after orientation changes.

```javascript
import { Dimensions } from 'react-native';

const { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');

console.log('Width:', width);
console.log('Height:', height);
```
